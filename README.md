# Spare Parts Quotation System

This repository contains the source code for our new automated quotation system. This web application will allow customers to request quotations for spare parts, including their vehicle's chassis number, which will streamline our internal sales process.

## Features

- **Quotation Request Form:** A simple form for customers to submit their details and parts list.
- **Chassis Number Input:** Dedicated field for accurate part identification.
- **Black & Gold Theme:** Professional and inviting design.

## How to Get Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-url]
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the Project Folder:**
    ```bash
    cd [your-project-name]
    ```
3.  **Open in Browser:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to see the page.

## Next Steps

- Add a spare parts catalog page.
- Implement JavaScript to handle form submission and communicate with the backend.
- Build the backend API for processing quotation requests and generating PDFs.
- Integrate with a Chassis Decoder API to perform intelligent part lookups.
